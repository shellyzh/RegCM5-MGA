# RegCM5-MGA
These are codes for an optimization framework RegCM5-MGA that couples the fifth version of Regional Climate Model (RegCM5) with a microgenetic algorithm (MGA). It is specifically used for optimizing five Tiedtke scheme parameters over one selected domain and one (continuous) timeframe. For the parameter details, please refer to the paper.

## General Usage Instructions

**ga.namelist.in** specifies the set up of RegCM5-MGA, users should update them and recompile the program

**mpihost** files are for job submissions (serverName:numberOfCores). The authors executed the programs based on GNU/Linux system, and the jobs are distributed to five mpihosts. Please ensure you have adapted the program to your system before running.

**prog.f90** files are for program compilation. After modifying any .f90 files, compile by running this command (*runga* can be replaced by other names that you desire):
ifort prog.main.f90 -oÂ runga.exe

Among the .f90 files, please replace **{your_working_dir}** with the path to your working directory, and replace **{your_fitness_function}** with the path to your defined fitness functions

Two examples are included in *fitness-function-examples*, one for mean absolute error (MAE) based on precipitation values, and one for normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) based on precipitation values.
